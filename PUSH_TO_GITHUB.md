# Push to your repository
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Initialize Fresh Repository**

If this is a new project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\AI\Cancer_MLOPs

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete MLOps platform"

# Add your remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jaideep27/Cancer_Prediction-MLOPs-.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚠️ Before Pushing - Final Checklist

- [ ] Remove any .env files with secrets
- [ ] Check no large model files (*.pkl, *.joblib) - should be in .gitignore
- [ ] Verify no personal API keys or passwords
- [ ] Test that the code runs locally
- [ ] All placeholder text is replaced (already done ✅)

### Quick Check:
```bash
# See what will be committed
git status

# See which files are tracked
git ls-files

# Make sure these are NOT included:
# - venv/
# - models/**/*.pkl
# - data/raw/*.csv
# - .env
# - logs/
```

## 📝 For Your Resume

**Bullet Point:**
```
Engineered an end-to-end MLOps platform for breast cancer diagnosis
achieving 97% accuracy using hybrid ensemble methods (Logistic Regression,
Gradient Boosting, Neural Network). Built FastAPI REST API with MLflow
experiment tracking, model versioning, and registry management. Implemented
GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, statistical data drift detection, and
Prometheus/Grafana monitoring. Deployed via Docker Compose and Kubernetes
with 4-service architecture featuring auto-scaling, ingress routing, and
persistent storage.
```

**Skills to Highlight:**
- Machine Learning & Ensemble Methods
- MLOps (MLflow, Model Registry, Experiment Tracking)
- API Development (FastAPI, REST, OpenAPI)
- DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Python, pytest, Data Science
- Cloud-Native Architecture
